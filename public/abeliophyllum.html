            <b>Abeliophyllum (White Forsythia, or Korean Abelialeaf)</b> is a
            monotypic genus of flowering plants in the olive family, Oleaceae.
            It consists of one species, <b>Abeliophyllum distichum Nakai</b>,
            endemic to Korea, where it is endangered in the wild, occurring at
            only seven sites. It is related to Forsythia, but differs in having
            white, not yellow, flowers.
          </p>

          <p>
            It is a deciduous shrub growing to 1 to 2 m tall. The leaves are
            opposite, simple, 6 to 10 cm long and 3 to 4.5 cm wide, pubescent
            both above and below. The flowers are produced in early spring
            before the new leaves appear; they are white and fragrant, about 1
            cm long, with a four-lobed corolla. The fruit is a round, winged
            samara 2 to 3 cm diameter.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is cultivated as an ornamental plant in Europe and North America.
