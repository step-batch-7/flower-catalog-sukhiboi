            Ageratum, (whiteweed in the USA), is a genus of 40[3] to 60 tropical
            and warm temperate flowering annuals and perennials from the family
            Asteraceae, tribe Eupatorieae. Most species are native to Central
            America and Mexico but four are native to the United States.

            They form tussocks or small hills. They grow to a height of 30 in.
            The opposite leaves are cordate or oval, hairy or tomentose. The
            margins are slightly toothed or serrate. The leaves form compact
            clusters.

            The fluffy flowers are lavender-blue, pink, lilac, or white; and
            spread in small compound umbels. They give small, dry fruits.
